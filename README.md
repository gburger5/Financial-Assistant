# Financial-Assistant
The proposed project is a multi-agent personal financial assistant designed to help users
manage and optimize their finances. Each autonomous agent focuses on a specific aspect of a
user’s finances budgeting, savings, investments, and debt repayment. The agents communicate
and coordinate to provide a holistic view of financial health, optimize resource allocation, and
offer personalized recommendations.
